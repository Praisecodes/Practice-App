# Practce App
### App for perfecting API call using CURL (libcurl) in C++.
In this app I was able to create a login and signup system using C++ programming language! <br>
Previously/prior to this time, I would achive this using the following:
- SQLite database
- C++ File System
But now, I have been able to achieve this using API's in C++. <br>
With API's I'm able to:
- Connect to a database on a server
- Build corresponding desktop apps in correlation to web applications I build or I participate in building
- Build bigger CLI based applications (Just like this particular one).

### How did I achieve this?
---
I implemented:
- C++ Programming Language
- [Nlohmann's](https://github.com/nlohmann) [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) library for converting arrays, maps and files from JSON to C++ readable formate and vice versa.
- [libcurl](https://github.com/xquery/curl) for C++
